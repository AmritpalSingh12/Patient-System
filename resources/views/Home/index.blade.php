                    <div id="faq1" class="collapse" data-bs-parent=".faq-list">
                        <p>
                            Patients cannot see their detailed coded record until the practice lets them by opening up access. Patients have to ask their practice for access and the practice should have a process for how to register patients. Before patients can register, the practice needs to confirm that the patient is who they say they are. When the patient is registered, but before they are given online access to their detailed coded record, the practice will need to check the record to ensure that no third party information is disclosed or any other information that may cause harm to the patient or any other person.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Each practice decides if it wants to offer online services to children and from what age that access should be allowed. You can find more information on this in the GP online services practice toolkit which has been produced by the Royal College of General Practitioners in collaboration with NHS England.</p>

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately we do not provide materials in other languages. It is the practiceâ€™s responsibility to adapt for their practice population.

                            Some patients share their email address with another person, this can be a problem when setting passwords or changing information. Please make sure patients understand the risks around having a shared email address when using GP online services.
